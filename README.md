Record the answers I have done from the online judge platform .(e.g.[PTA](https://pintia.cn/),[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/),[CodeWar](http://www.codewars.com)...)

**WARNING** 
- State: Still on :construction:, update daily as much as possible!
<!-- ## How to test snippets ?
- I recorded some useful algorithms in Tools/Snippets/, and also wrote some unit tests to illustrate the usage of these snippets
- Now, Only support test them manually... :cyclone:
- For example:
```bash
$ export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=<PATH-TO>/OJ/Tools/third_party_libs/unit_test/ # G++
$ g++ test_<TEST_NAME> # Compile single test
$ ./a.out # Check Test Result
```
- Will change this way in the future, expecting! -->
